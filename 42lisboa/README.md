# 42 Lisboa – Programming Projects

This folder contains programming projects developed at 42 Lisboa as part of an intensive peer-to-peer learning program.

These projects focus on building strong foundations in computer science, with emphasis on:

- Low-level programming in C
- Memory management
- Algorithms and data structures
- Performance optimization
- Problem-solving and structured thinking

## Projects Overview

### C Projects
Core projects focused on system-level programming using the C language.

- **libft**  
  Custom implementation of standard C library functions.

- **ft_printf**  
  Recreation of the `printf` function, focusing on variadic functions and formatting.

- **get_next_line**  
  File reading project with buffer and memory management.

---

### Algorithms
Projects focused on algorithmic thinking and optimization strategies.

- **push_swap**  
  Sorting algorithms implemented with constrained operations.

- **Piscine exercises**  
  Logic and algorithm practice exercises completed during the 42 Piscine.

## Learning Outcomes
Through these projects, I developed skills in:

- Writing efficient and readable C code
- Debugging and memory management
- Algorithmic reasoning
- Working under constraints and project-based deadlines
- Peer code reviews and collaborative problem-solving
