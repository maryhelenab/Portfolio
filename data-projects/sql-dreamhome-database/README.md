**Dreamhome Database – SQL Practice Project**

This section presents a practical SQL project developed using the Dreamhome database, a fictional real estate agency scenario used during database and SQL training.

The project focuses on applying SQL concepts to solve realistic business questions, reinforcing relational database design, data querying, and analytical thinking.
