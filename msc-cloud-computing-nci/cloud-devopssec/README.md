# Cloud DevOps Projects

**Overview**
This folder contains practical labs and projects developed as part of the Master’s Degree in Cloud Computing at NCI, focused on Cloud Engineering, DevOps practices, automation, secure application deployment, and modern backend development. Each subfolder represents a hands-on lab or project demonstrating real-world cloud development workflows and infrastructure practices.

---

## Objectives

* Apply DevOps principles in cloud environments
* Develop and deploy Python applications
* Implement secure authentication mechanisms
* Build and test web applications
* Automate workflows and infrastructure tasks
* Practice debugging and code quality improvement

---

## Architecture Overview

All labs were developed in a cloud-based development environment using AWS Cloud9. Projects simulate real-world development scenarios where applications are built, tested, and validated in a Linux environment with command-line tools, Python scripts, and web frameworks.

Each lab focuses on a specific skill area such as Python scripting, Django web development, authentication systems, and deployment workflows. Together, they demonstrate progressive mastery of cloud-based software development practices.

## Technologies and Tools

* Python 3
* Django
* AWS Cloud9
* Linux CLI
* Git & GitHub
* pip
* Virtual Environments
* Static Analysis Tools
