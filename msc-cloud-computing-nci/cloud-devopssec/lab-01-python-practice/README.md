# Lab 01 – Practice Programming in Python

**Student:** Maryhelen Bastos  
**Module:** Cloud DevOpsSec  
**Programme:** MSc in Cloud Computing  
**Institution:** National College of Ireland  

**Overview**  
This lab is part of the Cloud DevOpsSec module within the Master’s Degree in Cloud Computing at the National College of Ireland (NCI).  
The purpose of this lab is to practice fundamental Python programming concepts and object-oriented programming principles, supporting automation and scripting tasks in DevOps and cloud security environments.

**Objectives**
- Practice basic Python syntax and command-line input/output operations  
- Apply object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, methods, and inheritance  
- Implement simple business logic through structured programming exercises  
- Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking skills using Python  

**Architecture Overview**  
This lab consists of standalone Python scripts executed locally using the command-line interface (CLI).  
No cloud infrastructure, APIs, or external services were required for this implementation.

**Technologies and Tools**
- Python 3  
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)  
- Command-line interface (PowerShell / Terminal)  
- Python Standard Library

**Description**  
This lab is composed of four independent programming exercises:

- **Problem 1:** A user interaction program that requests the user’s name and prints a personalized greeting message.  
- **Problem 2:** Implementation of a Bank Account class supporting deposit, withdrawal, and balance display operations.  
- **Problem 3:** Development of two employee classes using inheritance to calculate salaries based on commission and base salary plus commission.  
- **Problem 4:** Design and implementation of a simple terminal-based game (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors or Hangman) using conditional logic and control flow structures.  

**How to Run**
1. Install Python 3 on your machine  
2. Open a terminal in the project folder  
3. Run the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
python problem1_greeting.py
python problem2_bank_account.py
python problem3_employees.py
python problem4_game.py
