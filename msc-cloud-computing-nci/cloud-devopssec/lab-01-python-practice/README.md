# Lab 01 – Practice Programming in Python

**Overview**  
This lab is part of the Cloud DevOpsSec module within the Master’s Degree in Cloud Computing at NCI.
It focuses on practicing fundamental Python programming concepts through a set of structured programming exercises, reinforcing skills required for DevOps and security automation tasks.

**Objectives**
- Practice basic Python syntax and command-line input/output operations
- Apply object-oriented programming concepts using classes and methods
- Implement simple business logic through programming exercises
- Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking skills using Python

**Architecture Overview**  
This lab consists of standalone Python programs executed locally via the command-line interface.
No cloud infrastructure or external services were required for this lab.

**Technologies and Tools**
- Python 3
- Command-line interface (PowerShell / Terminal)
- Python standard library

**Description**  
This lab is composed of four independent programming exercises designed to reinforce Python fundamentals.

Problem 1 focuses on user interaction by requesting input from the user and displaying a personalized greeting message.

Problem 2 introduces object-oriented programming concepts through the implementation of a bank account class, supporting basic operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance display.

Problem 3 expands on object-oriented design by modeling two types of employees using inheritance, with logic to calculate and display employee salaries.

Problem 4 involves designing and implementing a simple terminal-based game, such as Rock-Paper-Scissors or Hangman, applying control flow structures, conditional logic, and user interaction.

**Outputs**
- Python scripts implementing each problem
- Terminal output demonstrating program execution and user interaction
- Console-based results for each exercise

**Learning Outcomes**
- Improved understanding of Python syntax and program structure
- Practical application of object-oriented programming principles
- Experience designing and testing small Python applications
- Foundational skills for DevOps automation and secure scripting

**Conclusion**  
This lab provided essential hands-on experience with Python programming, supporting the development of DevOpsSec skills required for automation, scripting, and secure cloud operations.
